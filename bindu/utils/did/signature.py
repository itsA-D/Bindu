    """Create the signature payload a signer or verifier should sign.

    The returned dict is serialized with ``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)``
    by the caller and passed to Ed25519. Signer and verifier MUST agree
    on the exact bytes, which means they MUST agree on how ``body`` was
    serialized to bytes before this function is called.

    Only ``str`` and ``bytes`` are accepted. Passing ``dict`` used to
    be supported with an implicit ``json.dumps(body, sort_keys=True)``
    canonicalization, but that hid a serious footgun: a caller who
    signed a dict got one signature, and the verifier on the server
    side (which receives raw wire bytes, not a dict) got another for
    the same logical body. The mismatch surfaced as
    ``crypto_mismatch`` with no diagnostic hint about why.

    The fix: callers must serialize their body to bytes *once* and use
    those exact bytes for both the signing payload AND the HTTP body
    they send on the wire. If you have a dict and need to sign it,
    serialize it explicitly::

        body_bytes = json.dumps(data).encode("utf-8")
