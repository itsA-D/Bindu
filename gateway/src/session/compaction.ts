 * Strategy (Phase 1 — simple, effective, replaceable later):
 *   1. Estimate total tokens in history.
 *   2. If over the trigger fraction of the usable context window:
 *      a. Split history at `keepTail` turns from the end.
 *      b. Summarize the head into one paragraph via a cheap model call.
 *      c. Store the summary on the session row.
 *      d. Mark all compacted messages with `compacted=true` so history()
 *         calls skip them.
 *   3. On next `prompt()`, the session loader prepends the summary as a
 *      synthetic system message, then loads only non-compacted turns.
 *
 * Rationale for summary-based rather than truncation: for multi-agent
 * plans, the load-bearing facts are scattered across tool results. Simple
 * truncation loses them. A paragraph is much cheaper than raw history and
 * preserves the planner's ability to reference past calls.
