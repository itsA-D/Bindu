"""Tests for ``create_signature_payload`` and ``sign_request`` contract.

The single invariant these tests guard: **the caller must serialize
its body to bytes/str exactly once, and both the signing path and
the wire must use those exact bytes.** The pre-cleanup function
silently canonicalized a dict into a different string than the
bytes that would hit the wire, which caused dict-caller +
bytes-verifier pairs to disagree on the signature even when they
were signing the same logical data.

The cleanup removes the ``dict`` input branch — callers with a dict
now have to serialize explicitly, which surfaces the choice of
canonicalization and prevents the silent-mismatch bug.

See ``bugs/core/2026-04-19-create-signature-payload-dict-branch.md``
when it lands for the full story.
